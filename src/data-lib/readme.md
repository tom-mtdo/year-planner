* Notes
** For components inside parents which generate id for children, like repeating group
- Dont pass in dataPath, compId, parentId and path because they will override dynamic id & path generated by lib
- Need compName as parents use it to generate compId and data path

** Using build id & data path feature
- If random comp -> use static id & path
- Comp in a "form" -> use either static or generated id & path
- Comp in a dynamic parent, e.g. repeating group -> use generated id & path
